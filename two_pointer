two pointer is really an easy and effective technique which is typically used for searching pairs in a sorted array.

scenario: 
1. given a sorted array(sorted in ascending order)
2. having N integers
3. find if there exists any pair of elements A[i], A[j] such that their sum is equal to X.

How it works?
The sum of the first and last element of the array is like the mid value of sum of the array. 
Based on comparision result of mid value and the target sum, move the pointers just like binary search 

Time complexity:
o(n)
