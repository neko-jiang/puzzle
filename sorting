A sorting algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparision operator on the elements. The comparision operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure. 

Common sorting algorithms:
Merge sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, quick sort, heaps sort

NOTE:
It might be in increasing or decreasing order. 

Merge sort:
Divide and conquer. 
It divides input array in two halves, call itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves.
