Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. 
Operator:
~ :inverts a bit pattern. reverts all bits. change "00000000" would change its pattern to "11111111".

<< : left shift. shift a bit pattern to left.

>> : right shift. shift a bit pattern to right. 

& : bitwise AND
^ : Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.同为0，异为1.

| : Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in eather operand.
