Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. 

Value is hashed to an unique value. 

Assume that you have an object and you want to assign a key to it and make searching easy. To store the key/value pairs, you can use a simple array like data structure where keys can be used directly as an index to store values. 
In hashing, large keys are converted into small keys by using hash functions. The values are then stored in a data structure called hash table. The idea of hashing is to distribute entries uniformly accorss an array. Each element is assigned a key. By using that key you can access the element in o(1) time. 

Hash function:
A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitray size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. 
The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.


Hash table
A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into array in which an element will be inserted or searched. The average time required to search for an element in a hash table is o(1).
