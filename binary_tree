A binary tree is either empty(represeneted by a null pointer), or is made of a single node, where the left and right pointers each point to a binary tree.

A "binary search tree" (BST) or "ordered binary tree" is a type of binary tree where the nodes are arranged in order. 
All elements in its left are less or equal to the node, all the elements in its right substree are greater than the node.
